# 🚀 What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework that helps build fast, SEO-friendly, full-stack web applications.

React alone is mainly for building UI.
Next.js adds routing, server rendering, backend APIs, and performance optimizations on top of React.

In simple words:

  Next.js = React + Routing + Backend + Server Rendering + Optimization

 ## Why do we need Next.js?

React (Vite/CRA) apps run fully in the browser and need extra setup for routing, SEO, and performance.
Next.js solves these problems out of the box.

# Why use Next.js?
1. File-Based Routing => No React Router needed.

Routes are created using folders and files:
``` app/page.js        → /
app/login/page.js → /login ```
--- 
Each folder becomes a URL automatically. This makes routing simple and clean.
